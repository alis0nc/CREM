Critical Optimism,5/4/19,16:00,5/4/19,17:00,Charlevoix B,Tech,"People’s ability to envision the future tends to fall between two unhealthy and unconstructive extremes.

At the other extreme are those so critical of technology that they adopt an unrealistic Luddite attitude, avoiding technology altogether, or they assume that a dystopian future is inevitable and, as a result, become passive. Critical optimism navigates between these two extremes, encouraging an earnest hopefulness that also incorporates a healthy dose of criticality.

As a diabetic, the presenter built this system and saw her sugar values stabilize much more than would be possibly by managing them manually. Learn about  OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. The presenter will also share her personal experience and what OpenAPS means for her health now and in the future.
